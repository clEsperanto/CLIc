# CLIc

CLIc is a prototype for [CLesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto) - a multi-language framework for GPU-accelerated image processing. It uses [OpenCL kernels](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clij-opencl-kernels/tree/development/src/main/java/net/haesleinhuepf/clij/kernels) from [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io/)

Right now, this is very preliminary, and mainly focussed on running a few kernel using the OpenCL C++ API.

# Installation

## Requierements

- [LibTiff](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/)
- [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) 
(
    [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads), 
    [AMD](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases), 
    [Intel](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/opencl-sdk.html)
)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

## Install

clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype.git
```
download the submodule required (here the CLIJ kernels)
```
cd CLIc_prototype
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
create de build folder and call cmake from it to generate a make file
```
mkdir build  
cd build  
ccmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..  
```
call make to compile.
```
make 
```

## Troubleshooting

Cmake control the project configuration and linking to required libraries. If the libraries and their respective includes folder are installed and/or specified in your environment PATH, it should automatically find it and manage the dependencies to the project. Otherwise, CMake will fail the configuration steps.

### LibTiff

If not in PATH environment, it is possible to specify the library location in cmake via the GUI using the following variables:
- TIFF_LIBRARY → which should point to libtiff compiled library (.so for Unix, .lib for Windows)
- TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR → which should point to the include folder containing the tiffio<span>.h and tiff<span>.h  

#### Linux:
Running the following in a terminal will download and install libtiff on your system
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libtiff-dev 
```

#### MacOS:
Normally already installed, it is also possible to get it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via the following line in terminal
```
sudo brew update
sudo brew install libtiff
```

#### Windows:
Download the latest source code version on the library [website](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/). The code can be compile using the following commande line in the [x64 Native Tools Command Prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=vs-2019) of windows
```
nmake /f makefile.vc
```
Both compiled library and includes will be found in the libtiff folder.
More information on libtiff compilation [here](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/build.html)

### OpenCL

Same as for the TIFF library, it is possible to specify the library location via CMake GUI with the variables:
- OPENCL_LIBRARY → which should point to libOpenCL or OpenCL compiled library (.so for Unix, .lib for Windows)
- OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR → which should point to a folder containg CL/cl<span>.htiff<span>.h 

#### Linux:
Running the following in a terminal will download and install OpenCL
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ocl-icd-opencl-dev 
```
It is however advised to get OpenCL via your GPU drivers and SDK.

#### MacOS:
Normally already installed on MacOS system. 
It is also possible to get it by installing both GPU drivers and SDK from the your GPU brand (NVidia, AMD, Intel, etc.).

#### Windows:
It is required to install it via the GPU drivers and SDK from the your GPU brand (NVidia, AMD, Intel, etc.).

### Kernels
CLIc rely on the [CLIj OpenCL kernels](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clij-opencl-kernels) and they are required for execution. Make sure you are downloading the submodule of the repository, or change the folder path variable CLI_Path in CMake configuration to point to the kernels location.

# Testing

| input  | add scalar = 127 | maximum z projection |
| :--------:  | :--------: | :--------: |
| <img src="./ressources/input.gif" width="200" height="200" /> | <img src="./ressources/output_add_image_and_scalar.gif" width="200" height="200" /> | <img src="./ressources/output_maximum_z_projection.png" width="200" height="200" /> |

The current main code run sequentially the add_image_and_scalar and maximum_z_projection kernel. And unitary kernel test can be found in the tests folder of the project and run using the following command in the build folder
```
make test
```

## Issues

- Running kernel limited to (for now)
    - add_image_and_scalar
    - maximum_z_projection  
- Only process buffer data. image2d_t and image3d_t not supported
- CI Workflow do not properly work
